# Employee-Task-React.js

## Getting started

 1. To start this project you need to go to terminal and write <b>npm install</b> to install all the dependancies.
 
 2. After installing all the dependancies you need to go to the directory <b>app</b> by typing <b>cd ./app</b> in terminal
 
   3.When we are in the <b>app</b> directory you need to type <b>npm start</b> to start React App.
   
   4.Also for the project i use Bootstrap which is inslalled when you type <b>npm install</b>


## Directory structure

The main file is App.js where is the Form for Employees and Tasks.


When we filled all the inputs for Employee and Task and click Add Employee or Add Task whe access two other files named View.js and ViewTask.js

View.js - display the table with the employee we add.


ViewTask.js -  display the table with the task we add.

In View.js file we access 2 other files EditRow.js and ReadRow.js


ReadRow.js displays all employee inputs and also two buttons DELETE and EDIT


EditRow.js is the logic of update the users which doesnt work :(
